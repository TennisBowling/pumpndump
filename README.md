# Downloading and running

#### lazy way

The lazy way is not recommended, because it dosen't let you see what code you are running. Anyways, if you do decide to continue, here's how:

create a new folder (name is irrelevant) and download the jar, and the other files (banlog.txt, token.txt) and put them in the folder. Edit the file token.txt, remove all text, and put your token on the first line. Now run pumpndump-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar, with ```java -jar pumpndump-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` make sure to change the x.x.x with the current number.

#### compiling way 

clone, then go into it and run ```mvn install``` then cd into ```target```, and edit the file token.txt, remove all text, and put your token on the first line. Now run pumpndump-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar, with ```java -jar pumpndump-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` make sure to change the x.x.x with the current number.
